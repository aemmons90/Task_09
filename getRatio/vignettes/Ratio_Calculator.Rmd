## Uses
Imagine having a data frame called "x" with two columns "Bacterial.DNA" and "Human.DNA." You want to divide the first column by the second to get a ratio of Bacterial.DNA to Human.DNA, and you want this new ratio DNA to be in a new column that you name "HuBac". You would use as follows:
```{r}
library(getRatio)

getRatio(x, "Bacterial.DNA", "Human.DNA", "HuBac")
```
